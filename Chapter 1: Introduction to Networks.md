# *Introduction to Networks*

## *Network Characteristics*
* Cost: cost of network component, installation, and on going maintenance
* Security: protection of network component, data they contain and/or the data transmitted between them
* Speed: how fast is data transmitted between network endpoints
* Topology: physical layout of cabling and logical way data path
* Scalability: how well the network can adapt to new growth, including new users, applications, and network components.
* Reliability: measure the reliability of the network components and the connectivity between them. MTBF is commonly used.
* Availability: Meausre the likely hood that network being available to the users. Uptime is define as the number of minutes network is available divided by the number of minutes in a year.
